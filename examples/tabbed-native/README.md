# RecAnalyst Example

This example renders the results of an analysis in a similar way to AoCZone,
with different tabs for different kinds of data.

## Try it out

  1. Clone the RecAnalyst repository:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/recanalyst
     ```

  2. Move into this directory:

     ```
     cd examples/tabbed-native
     ```

  4. Run demo server:

     ```
     composer run-script serve
     # Or:
     php -S localhost:8080 # Pick your favourite port!
     ```
